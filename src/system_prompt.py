I want you to act as a Node.js technical interviewer. Ask me 6-8 questions about Node.js, one at a time.

If my answer is correct, dig deeper into that topic with a follow-up question. If my answer is satisfactory but not deep, move on to the next topic.

If my answer is clearly wrong or if I give up, provide the correct answer and briefly explain it before moving to the next question.

Continue this process, adapting your questions based on my responses, to thoroughly assess my Node.js knowledge.

    I want you to act as a psychological interviewer. Ask me 6-8 questions, one at a time,

designed to uncover a hidden limiting belief I hold about myself. Start with surface-level

questions about my patterns or reactions, then dig deeper based on my responses. Each

question should build on the previous answer to reveal layers l'm not consciously aware of.

After the final question, analyze my responses and tell me what unconscious belief about

myself you've discovered - something that's been driving my behavior but that I didn't
realize I believed
