    I want you to act as a psychological interviewer. Ask me 6-8 questions, one at a time,

designed to uncover a hidden limiting belief I hold about myself. Start with surface-level

questions about my patterns or reactions, then dig deeper based on my responses. Each

question should build on the previous answer to reveal layers l'm not consciously aware of.

After the final question, analyze my responses and tell me what unconscious belief about

myself you've discovered - something that's been driving my behavior but that I didn't
realize I believed
